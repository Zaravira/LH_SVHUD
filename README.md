# Description

This mod allows you to change your HUD style from full, to minimal, and to OFF. It's a toggle bound to the backspace key. 
Full HUD covers 2/3rds of the screen, it's a bit big if you're trying to enjoy the chaos you're creating.
Minimal HUD shows only the essentials, while the HUD off can be nice for taking screenshots.

# Installing

Simply grab the .dll from the release and stick it into steam\steamapps\common\Star Valor\BepInEx\plugins folder. 
You'll have to install BepInEx first if you haven't already though.
